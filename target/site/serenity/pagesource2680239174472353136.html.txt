    <h1>Where's What Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small-text">Updated and effective as of 26th October 2015.</p>
    <p>
        Evo Automation owns and provides various websites (the "<strong>Websites</strong>"), services, and software (such as www.whereswhat.com) that facilitate company asset management, booking and tracking (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). In this Privacy Policy, we may refer to Evo Automation as "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>we</strong>". "<strong>User</strong>" refers to any individual or organization using the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your privacy is critically important to us. At Evo Automation we have a few fundamental principles:
        </p><ul>
            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
            </li>
            <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our product, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
            <li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        The following Privacy Policy outlines how Evo Automation will treat information as you use the Services. By using the services, you accept the terms set forth in this privacy policy and in our Terms of use.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team using the online chat available on the website and in the app or via email at support@whereswhat.com .
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-policy">Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>
        Like most website operators, Evo Automation collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Evo Automation’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Evo Automation’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Evo Automation may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>
        Certain visitors to Evo Automation’s websites choose to interact with Evo Automation in ways that require Evo Automation to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Evo Automation gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Evo Automation to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Evo Automation – by purchasing access to the premium features – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Evo Automation collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Evo Automation. Evo Automation does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
    <p>
        Evo Automation may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Evo Automation may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Evo Automation does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>
        Evo Automation discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Evo Automation’s behalf or to provide services available at Evo Automation’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Evo Automation’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Evo Automation will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Evo Automation discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Evo Automation believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Evo Automation, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Evo Automation website and have supplied your email address, Evo Automation may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Evo Automation and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Evo Automation takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Child Protection</h3>
    <p>
        We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-policy">Cookies</h3>
    <p>
        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Evo Automation uses cookies to help Evo Automation identify and track visitors, their usage of Evo Automation website, and their website access preferences. Evo Automation visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Evo Automation’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Evo Automation’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>
        If Evo Automation, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Evo Automation goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Evo Automation may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Ads</h3>
    <p>
        Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Evo Automation and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-policy">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Evo Automation may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Evo Automation’s sole discretion. Evo Automation encourages visitors and users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
